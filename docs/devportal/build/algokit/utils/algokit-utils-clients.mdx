There are various ways to interact with deployed smart contracts and the Algorand blockchain, but the easiest way is to use the user-facing
clients available through AlgoKit Utils. This page explains these clients and how you can use them to facilitate on-chain activities such as sending
a transaction, building atomic transfers, calling smart contracts, and more.

## Types of AlgoKit Clients

Currently, there are two AlgoKit clients available for interacting with the Algorand blockchain:

### Algorand Client

The Algorand client is the default entry point for interacting with the Algorand blockchain. This includes:

- Crafting and Sending [10 different types](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/classes/types_algorand_client.AlgorandClient.md#send) of transactions
- Accessing algod, indexer, kmd clients
- Setting various configuration parameters

### Typed Application Client

The typed application client is a smart contract client that wraps an [ARC-0032](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0032) app spec-defined smart contract and provides high-productivity
methods for deploying and calling smart contracts.

:::note
We are currently working to integrate the typed app client into `AlgorandClient`, thus making it the single entry point for all Algorand client functionalities.
:::

## AlgorandClient

The `AlgorandClient` class included in AlgoKit Utils for TypeScript (and coming soon to Python Utils) is the default entry point for all Algorand functionalities.
Use it to craft and send transactions individually or bundled as atomic transaction groups, access SDK clients (`algod`, `indexer`, `kmd`), and quickly set configuration parameters, with sensible defaults.

### Instantiating the AlgorandClient

To use the `AlgorandClient` in your codebase, you can use various methods provided by the class to configure the network connection:

<Code code={networkConfig} lang='ts' />

### Accessing the SDK Clients

Once you have an `AlgorandClient` instance, you can access the SDK clients for the various Algorand APIs via the `algorand.client` property:

<Code code={sdkclients} lang='ts' />

For more information about the functionalities of the SDK clients, refer to the following pages:

- [algod](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/algod/)
- [Indexer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/indexer/)
- [kmd](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/rest-apis/kmd/)

### Crafting Transactions with the AlgorandClient

Sometimes you may need to craft a transaction before sending it. The `AlgorandClient` provides a method to build transactions. The following example demonstrates how to build an `assetTransfer` transaction:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript' icon='seti:typescript'>
    <Code code={buildTxn} lang='ts' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
To learn about all properties, accessors, and methods available in the AlgorandClient, refer to the
[AlgorandClient reference page](
https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts/blob/main/docs/code/classes/types_algorand_client.AlgorandClient.md)

### Sending Transactions with the AlgorandClient

With the AlgorandClient you can easily send transactions on the Algorand blockchain. The following example demonstrates how to send a `payment` transaction:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript' icon='seti:typescript'>
    <Code code={sendTxn} lang='ts' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Typed Application Client

:::note
Soon, the application client will be integrated into the Algorand Client, which will become the single interface for all Algorand functionalities, including deploying and calling smart contracts.
:::

The `ApplicationClient` class within AlgoKit Utils for TypeScript and Python wraps an ARC-0032 app spec and provides high-productivity methods for
deploying and calling the app. Use the `ApplicationClient` for all smart contract interactions, including deploying, calling, and reading smart contracts.

### Generating the ApplicationClient Class

When compiled, all ARC4 smart contracts generate an `arc32.json` file. This file contains the smart contract's extended ABI,
which follows the [ARC-0032](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0032.md) standard.

The relevant smart contract's application client is generated using the ARC32 ABI file. There are two different ways to
generate an application client for a smart contract:

#### Using the AlgoKit Build CLI command

When you are using AlgoKit smart contract templates for your project, compiling your ARC4 smart contract written in either Python or TypeScript
will automatically generate the TypeScript or Python application client for you depending on what language you chose for contract interaction. Simply run the following command to generate four artifacts including the application client:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
algokit project run build
```

After running the command, you should see the following artifacts generated in the `artifacts` directory under the `smart_contracts` directory:

<Image src={artifacts} alt='Image of generated artifacts' />

#### Using the AlgoKit Generate CLI command

There is also an AlgoKit CLI command to generate the application client for a smart contract. You can also use it to define custom commands inside of the `.algokit.toml` file in your project directory.
Note that you can specify what language you want for the application clients with the file extensions `.ts` for TypeScript and `.py` for Python.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
# To output a single arc32.json to a TypeScript typed app client:
algokit generate client path/to/arc32.json --output client.ts

# To process multiple arc32.json in a directory structure and output to a TypeScript app client for each in the current directory:
algokit generate client smart_contracts/artifacts --output {contract_name}.ts

# To process multiple arc32.json in a directory structure and output to a Python client alongside each arc32.json:
algokit generate client smart_contracts/artifacts --output {app_spec_path}/client.py
```

### Creating an ApplicationClient

To create an instance of an `ApplicationClient`, import the file containing the auto-generated `ApplicationClient` class and proceed as follows:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript' icon='seti:typescript'>
    <Code code={instantiateAppclient} lang='ts' />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={instantiate_appclient} lang='py' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Deploying a Smart Contract

To deploy a smart contract to a network using the application client instance, follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript' icon='seti:typescript'>
    <Code code={deployContract} lang='ts' />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={deploy_contract} lang='py' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Calling a Smart Contract Method

To call a smart contract method using the application client instance, follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript' icon='seti:typescript'>
    <Code code={callMethod} lang='ts' />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={call_method} lang='py' />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
