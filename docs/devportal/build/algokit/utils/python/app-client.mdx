Application client that works with
[ARC-0032](https://arc.algorand.foundation/ARCs/arc-0032) application spec defined
smart contracts. ARC-0032 is a standard for defining smart contracts on Algorand that provides
descriptive metadata about the smart contract to clients, including state docsSchema, default method arguments,
and custom data types.

By generating an app client, you are provided with a high-productivity client that enables
you to easily and safely create, update, delete, deploy, and call a smart contract and access state data for it.

### Design

The design for the app client is based on a wrapper for parsing an ARC-0032 application spec and
wrapping the [App deployment](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy) functionality and corresponding
[design](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy#design).

## App Client Generation

Follow the steps below to generate an app client:

<Steps>
1. **Prerequisites**

      To be able to consume the generated file you need to include it in a Python project that has, at a minimum, the `algokit-utils` package installed.
      ```shell showLineNumbers=false
      poetry add algokit-utils@^2.2.0
      ```

2.  **Installation**

    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
    pipx install algokit-client-generator
    ```

3.  **Client Generation**

          ```shell showLineNumbers=false
          algokit generate client path/to/application.json --output path/to/output/client_generated.py
          ```

          For example, and assuming that you used the AlgoKit CLI to bootstrap your python smart contract project and you named your app "hello_world", you
          would run the following command:

          ```shell showLineNumbers=false
          algokit generate client smart_contracts/artifacts/hello_world/HelloWorld.arc32.json
            --output smart_contracts/artifacts/hello_world/HelloWorld_generated.py
          ```

</Steps>

:::note
If you are using the [AlgoKit CLI](/tutorials/getting-started) to bootstrap and manage your project, the included build scripts will generate your app client for you. The generated client will be placed in the `smart_contracts/artifacts/{app_name}` directory.

## Usage

There are two key ways of instantiating an `ApplicationClient`:

- **Using App ID** - When needing to call an existing app by app ID or unconditionally create a new app. The
  function `ApplicationClient(algod_client, app_spec, app_id)` requires:

  - `algod_client`: An `AlgodClient` object
  - `app_spec`: An `ApplicationSpecification` object
  - `app_id`: The app_id of an existing application, or 0 if creating a new app

- **Using Creator and App Name** - When needing to deploy or find an app associated with a specific creator
  account and app name. The function `ApplicationClient(algod_client, app_spec, creator, indexer, app_lookup)`
  requires:
  - `algod_client`: An `AlgodClient`
  - `app_spec`: An `ApplicationSpecification`
  - `creator`: The address or `Account` of the creator of the app for which to search for the deployed app
    under
  - `indexer`:
  - `app_lookup`: Optional if an indexer is provided,
  - `app_name`: An overridden name to identify the contract with, otherwise `contract.name` is used from the
    app spec

Both approaches also allow specifying the following parameters that will be used as defaults for all
application calls: - `signer`: `TransactionSigner` to sign transactions with - `sender`: Address to use for transaction signing, will be derived from the signer if not provided - `suggested_params`: Default `SuggestedParams` to use; will use the current network suggested params by default

The above approaches also allow specifying a mapping of template values via the `template_values` parameter. This
will be used before compiling the application to replace any `TMPL_` variables that may be in the TEAL.

The `TMPL_UPDATABLE` and `TMPL_DELETABLE` variables used in some AlgoKit templates are handled by the `deploy`
method, but should be included if using `create` or `update` directly.

Example usage:

<Code code={createExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

## App Method Calls

There are various methods available on `ApplicationClient` that can be used to call an app:

- `call`: Used to call methods with an on complete action of `no_op`
- `create`: Used to create an instance of the app, by using an `app_id` of 0, includes the approval and clear
  programs in the call
- `update`: Used to update an existing app, includes the approval and clear programs in the call, and is
  called with an on complete action of `update_application`
- `delete`: Used to remove an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `delete_application`
- `opt_in`: Used to opt in to an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `opt_in`
- `close_out`: Used to close out of an existing app, is called with an on complete action of `opt_in`
- `clear_state`: Used to unconditionally close out from an app, calls the clear program of an app

Example usage:

<Code code={callAppMethodsExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

### ABI Method Calls

All methods for calling an app that support ABI methods (everything except `clear_state`) take a parameter
`call_abi_method` which can be used to specify which method to call. The method selected can be specified
explicitly, or allow the client to infer the method where possible.

Supported values are:

- `None`: The default value, when `None` is passed the client will attempt to find any ABI method or bare
  method that is compatible with the provided arguments
- `False`: Indicates that an ABI method should not be used, and instead a bare method call is made
- `True`: Indicates that an ABI method should be used, and the client will attempt to find an ABI method that
  is compatible with the provided arguments
- `str`: If a string is provided, it will be interpreted as either an ABI signature specifying a method, or as
  an ABI method name
- `algosdk.abi.Method`: The specified ABI method will be called
- `ABIReturnSubroutine`: Any type that has a `method_spec` function that returns an `algosd.abi.Method`

Example usage:

<Code code={abiMethodsExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

### ABI Arguments

ABI arguments are passed as python keyword arguments e.g., to pass the ABI parameter `name` for the ABI method
`hello` the following syntax is used:

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", name="world")
```

### Transaction Parameters

All methods for calling an app take an optional `transaction_parameters` argument, with the following
supported parameters:

- `signer`: The `TransactionSigner` to use on the call. This overrides any signer specified on the client
- `sender`: The address of the sender to use on the call, must be able to be signed for by the `signer`. This
  overrides any sender specified on the client
- `suggested_params`: `SuggestedParams` to use on the call. This overrides any suggested_params specified on
  the client
- `note`: Note to include in the transaction
- `lease`: Lease parameter for the transaction
- `boxes`: A sequence of boxes to use in the transaction, this is a list of (app_index, box_name) tuples
  `[(0, "box_name"), (0, ...)]`
- `accounts`: Account references to include in the transaction
- `foreign_apps`: Foreign apps to include in the transaction
- `foreign_assets`: Foreign assets to include in the transaction
- `on_complete`: The on complete action to use for the transaction, only available when using `call` or
  `create`
- `extra_pages`: Additional pages to allocate when calling `create`, by default a sufficient amount will be
  calculated based on the current approval and clear. This can be overridden, if more is required for a future
  update

Parameters can be passed as one of the dataclasses `CommonCallParameters`, `OnCompleteCallParameters`, or
`CreateCallParameters` (exact type depends on method used):

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", transaction_parameters=algokit_utils.OnCompleteCallParameters(signer=...))
```

Alternatively, parameters can be passed as a dictionary e.g.

```python showLineNumbers=false
client.call("hello", transaction_parameters={"signer":...})
```

## Transaction Composition

If multiple calls need to be made in a single transaction, the `compose_` method variants can be used. All
these methods take an `AtomicTransactionComposer` as their first argument. Once all the calls have been added
to the [Atomic Transaction Composer (ATC)](/concepts/transactions/atomic-txn-groups), it can then be executed.

Example usage:

<Code code={composingExample} lang='py' frame='none' />

## State Reading

There are various methods defined that let you read state from the smart contract app:

- `get_global_state` - Gets the current global state of the app
- `get_local_state` - Gets the current local state for the given account address

## Error Handling

Often when calling a smart contract during development you will get logic errors that cause an exception to
throw. This may be because of a failing assertion, a lack of fees, exhaustion of opcode budget, or any number
of other reasons.

When this occurs, you will generally get an error that looks something like the following:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
TransactionPool.Remember: transaction {TRANSACTION_ID}: logic eval error: {ERROR_MESSAGE}. Details: pc={PROGRAM_COUNTER_VALUE}, opcodes={LIST_OF_OP_CODES}
```

The information in that error message can be parsed and when combined with the
[source map from compilation](/build/algokit/utils/python/app-deploy#compilation-and-template-substitution)
you can expose debugging information that makes it much easier to understand what's happening.

When an error is thrown then the resulting error that is re-thrown will be a `LogicError`, which has the
following fields:

- `logic_error`: Original exception
- `program`: Program source (if available)
- `source_map`: Source map used (if available)
- `transaction_id`: Transaction ID of failing transaction
- `message`: The error message
- `line_no`: The line number in the TEAL program that
- `traces`: A list of Trace objects providing additional insights on simulation when debug mode is active

The function `trace()` will provide a formatted output of the surrounding TEAL where the error occurred.

### Extended Error Information

The extended information will only show if the Application Client has a source map. This will occur if:

- The `ApplicationClient` instance has already called (`create`, `update`, or `deploy`)
- `template_values` are provided when creating the `ApplicationClient`, so a SourceMap can be obtained automatically
- `approval_source_map` on `ApplicationClient` has been set from a previously compiled approval program
- A source map has been exported/imported using `export_source_map` / `import_source_map`

### Debug Mode and Traces Field

When debug mode is active, the `LogicError` will contain a field named `traces`. This field will include raw
simulate execution traces, providing a detailed account of the transaction simulation. These traces are
crucial for diagnosing complex issues and are automatically included in all application client calls when
debug mode is active.

<Aside type='caution' title='Enabling debug mode'>
  Remember to enable debug mode (`config.debug = True`) to include raw simulate execution traces in
  the `LogicError`.
