A dispenser is a mechanism commonly used to distribute non-MainNet tokens to users for testing and development purposes. It facilitates easy access to tokens supporting developers in covering necessary transaction fees for experimenting with applications and smart contracts.
The Algokit dispenser allows you to send funds to an account, whether you’re working on LocalNet or Testnet. You can do this programmatically so your account can get funded using a “dispenser” account with an Algo store.
There are different ways to achieve this:

- Via the Algokit account manager, either in [Python](/build/algokit/utils/python/account/) or [Typescript](/build/algokit/utils/ts/account/) - either automatically from LocalNet or the environment
- By directly interacting with the Algokit API Service for TestNet via API calls such as REST.
- Using the AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API client, which can be used to fund accounts on TestNet via a dedicated API service
  You also have the option to interact with the CLI to send funds to an account via the [Algokit CLI Dispenser](/build/algokit/cli/features/dispenser/).

## Dispenser via Account Manager

You can obtain an account object that is already funded and can act as a dispenser from the default LocalNet, or provide a specific account by adding a DISPENSER_MNEMONIC variable into your environment variables file.
The following methods can be used:

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
 <TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
      ```python showLineNumbers=false frame=none
      algokit_utils.get_dispenser_account()
      ``` 
      Returns an Account based on DISPENSER_MNEMONIC environment variable or the default account on LocalNet
 </TabItem>
 <TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
      ```typescript showLineNumbers=false frame=none
      algorand.account.dispenserFromEnvironment()
      ``` 
      Returns an account (with private key loaded) that can act as a dispenser from environment variables, or against default LocalNet if no environment variables present

      ```typescript showLineNumbers=false frame=none
      algorand.account.localNetDispenser()
      ```
      Returns an account with private key loaded that can act as a dispenser for the default LocalNet dispenser account

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Algokit TestNetDispenser API

The AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API provides functionalities for interacting with the Dispenser service. It is the base endpoint used by the Dispenser Clients described in the previous section.

You can find the Base URL (Production instance) here:

- [https://api.dispenser.algorandfoundation.tools](https://api.dispenser.algorandfoundation.tools)

To interact with it, all API endpoints require an Authorization header containing a valid JWT token. To get one, refer to the [AlgoKit CLI dispenser](/build/algokit/cli/features/dispenser/) command docs to learn how to obtain a valid JWT by using the next command: `algokit dispenser login –ci`

### Endpoints

**POST `/fund/{assetID}`**

Funds a user's wallet with a specified asset.

- URL Parameters

  - `assetID` - ID of the asset for which the funding limit is sought. Use 0 for ALGO.

- Request Body

  - `receiver` - Address of the wallet to be funded.
  - `amount` - Amount of the asset to be funded.

- Response

```json showLineNumbers=false
{
  "txID": "string",
  "amount": "number"
}
```

- `txID` - ID of the fund transaction from the dispenser to the requesting address.
- `amount` - Amount of the asset to be funded.

<br />
**GET ```/fund/{assetID}/limit```**

Fetches the funding limit for a specified asset.

- URL Parameters

  - `assetID` - ID of the asset for which the funding limit is sought. Use 0 for ALGO.

- Response

```json showLineNumbers=false
{
  "amount": "number"
}
```

- `amount` - Current daily amount limit for the requested asset.

<br />
**POST /refund**

Allows refunding a transaction. A status code `200` indicates a successful refund.

- Request Body
  - `refundTransactionID` - ID of the refund transaction.

### Error Handling

If an error occurs while interacting with the service, you will receive an error response with the following common format:

```json showLineNumbers=false
{
  "code": "string",
  "message": "string"
}
```

- `code` - Error code as described in the error codes table.
- `message` - Error message.

<br />
The following chart lists the details for each code:

| Status Code | Error Code             | Description                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `400`       | dispenser_out_of_funds | Dispenser is out of funds         |
| `403`       | forbidden              | Dispenser access is forbidden     |
| `400`       | fund_limit_exceeded    | Dispenser fund limit exceeded     |
| `400`       | missing_params         | Missing required input parameters |
| `403`       | authorization_error    | Authorization error               |
| `400`       | txn_expired            | Transaction expired               |
| `400`       | txn_invalid            | Invalid transaction               |
| `400`       | txn_already_processed  | Transaction already processed     |
| `404`       | txn_not_found          | Transaction not found             |
| `400`       | invalid_asset          | Unsupported asset ID              |
| `500`       | unexpected_error       | Unexpected internal error         |

## Algokit TestNet Dispenser Client

The TestNet Dispenser Client is a tool for working with the AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser API by instantiating a client.
It offers functions to:

- Fund an account
- Register a transaction refund
- And check the current account limit.

A detailed guide to using the Algokit TestNet dispenser can be found in the following sections depending on the needed language:

- [Python](/build/algokit/utils/python/dispenser/)
- [Typescript](/build/algokit/utils/ts/dispenser/)
