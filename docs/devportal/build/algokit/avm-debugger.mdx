The AVM VSCode debugger enables inspection of blockchain logic through `Simulate Traces` - JSON files containing detailed transaction execution data without on-chain deployment. The extension requires both trace files and source maps that link original code (TEAL or Puya) to compiled instructions.
While the extension works independently, projects created with algokit templates include utilities that automatically generate these debugging artifacts. For full list of available capabilities of debugger extension refer to this [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug).

This tutorial demonstrates the workflow using a Python-based Algorand project. We will walk through identifying and fixing a bug in an Algorand smart contract using the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) Debugger. We’ll start with a simple, smart contract containing a deliberate bug, and by using the AVM Debugger, we’ll pinpoint and fix the issue. This guide will walk you through setting up, debugging, and fixing a smart contract using this extension.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code (version 1.80.0 or higher)
- Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
- [algokit-cli](/build/algokit/what-is-algokit) installed
- [Algokit AVM VSCode Debugger](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug) extension installed
- Basic understanding of [Algorand smart contracts using Python](/concepts/smart-contracts/languages/python)

:::note
The extension is designed to debug both raw TEAL sourcemaps and sourcemaps generated via Puya compiler on the Algorand Virtual Machine. It provides a step-by-step debugging experience by utilizing transaction execution traces and compiled source maps of your smart contract.
:::

## Step 1: Setup the Debugging Environment

Install the Algokit AVM VSCode Debugger extension from the VSCode Marketplace by going to extensions in VSCode, then search for Algokit AVM Debugger and click install. You should see the output like the following:

<Image src={avmDebuggerExtension} alt='AVM Debugger Extension' />

## Step 2: Set Up the Example Smart Contract

We aim to debug smart contract code in a project generated via `algokit init`. Refer to set up [Algokit](/build/algokit/what-is-algokit). Here’s the Algorand Python code for an `tictactoe` smart contract. The bug is in the `move` method, where `games_played` is updated by `2` for guest and `1` for host (which should be updated by 1 for both guest and host).

Remove `hello_world` folder
Create a new tic tac toe smart contract starter via `algokit generate smart-contract -a contract_name "TicTacToe"`
Replace the content of `contract.py` with the code below.

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={avmDebuggerExample} lang='py' frame='none' showLineNumbers={false} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Add the below deployment code in `deploy.config` file:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={avmDebuggerDeployConfig} lang='py' frame='none' showLineNumbers={false} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Compile & Deploy the Smart Contract

To enable debugging mode and full tracing for each step in the execution, go to `main.py` file and add:

```python showLineNumbers=false
from algokit_utils.config import config
config.configure(debug=True, trace_all=True)
```

For more details, refer to [Debugger](/build/algokit/utils/python/debugging/):

Next compile the smart contract using AlgoKit:

```bash
algokit project run build
```

This will generate the following files in artifacts: `approval.teal`, `clear.teal`, `clear.puya.map`, `approval.puya.map` and `arc32.json` files.
The `.puya.map` files are result of the execution of puyapy compiler (which project run build command orchestrated and invokes automatically). The compiler has an option called `--output-source-maps` which is enabled by default.

Deploy the smart contract on localnet:

```bash
algokit project deploy localnet
```

This will automatically generate `*.appln.trace.avm.json` files in `debug_traces` folder, `.teal` and `.teal.map` files in sources.

The `.teal.map` files are source maps for TEAL and those are automatically generated every time an app is deployed via `algokit-utils`. Even if the developer is only interested in debugging puya source maps, the teal source maps would also always be available as a backup in case there is a need to fall back to more lower level source map.

### Expected Behavior

The expected behavior is that
`games_played` should be updated by `1` for both guest and host

### Bug

When `move` method is called, `games_played` will get updated incorrectly for guest player.

## Step 4: Start the debugger

In the VSCode, go to run and debug on left side. This will load the compiled smart contract into the debugger. In the run and debug, select debug TEAL via Algokit AVM Debugger. It will ask to select the appropriate `debug_traces` file.

:::note
This vscode launch config is pre bundled with the template. And there is also an alternative execution option where a developer needs to open the json file representing the trace they want to debug and click on the debug button on the top right corner (which will appear specifically on trace json files when extension is installed).
:::

<Image src={avmDebuggerDebugTraces} alt='AVM Debugger Debug Traces' />
Figure: Load Debugger in VSCode{' '}

Next it will ask you to select the source map file. Select the `approval.puya.map` file. Which would indicate to the debug extension that you would like to debug the given trace file using Puya sourcemaps, allowing you to step through high level python code. If you need to change the debugger to use TEAL or puya sourcemaps for other frontends such as Typescript, remove the individual record from `.algokit/sources/sources.avm.json` file or run the [debugger commands via VSCode command palette](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-avm-vscode-debugger#vscode-commands)

<Image src={avmDebuggerMapFile} alt='AVM Debugger Map File' />{' '}

## Step 5: Debugging the smart contract

Let’s now debug the issue:

<Image src={avmDebuggerStarted} alt='AVM Debugger Started' />{' '}

Enter into the `app_id` of the `transaction_group.json` file. This opens the contract. Set a breakpoint in the `move` method. You can also add additional breakpoints.

<Image src={avmDebuggerSmartContract} alt='AVM Debugger Smart Contract' />{' '}

On left side, you can see `Program State` which includes `program counter`, `opcode`, `stack`, `scratch space`. In `On-chain State` you will be able to see `global`, `local` and `box` storages for the application id deployed on localnet.

:::note:
We have used localnet but the contracts can be deployed on any other network. A trace file is in a sense agnostic of the network in which the trace file was generated in. As long as its a complete simulate trace that contains state, stack and scratch states in the execution trace - debugger will work just fine with those as well.
:::

Once you start step operations of debugging, it will get populated according to the contract. Now you can step-into the code.

## Step 6: Analyze the Output

Observe the `games_played` variable for guest is increased by 2 (incorrectly) whereas for host is increased correctly.

<Image src={avmDebuggerIncorrectCode} alt='AVM Debugger Bug' />

## Step 7: Fix the Bug

Now that we've identified the bug, let's fix it in our original smart contract in `move` method:

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='Python' icon='seti:python'>
    <Code code={avmDebuggerFixed} lang='py' frame='none' showLineNumbers={false} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 8: Re-deploy

Re-compile and re-deploy the contract using the `step 3`.

## Step 9: Verify again using Debugger

Reset the `sources.avm.json` file, then restart the debugger selecting `approval.puya.source.map` file. Run through `steps 4 to 6` to verify that the `games_played` now updates as expected, confirming the bug has been fixed as seen below.

:::note
You can alternatively also use `approval.teal.map` file instead of puya source map - for a lower-level TEAL debugging session. Refer to [Algokit AVM VSCode Debugger commands ](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-avm-vscode-debugger#vscode-command) via the VSCode command palette to automate clearing or editing the registry file.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we walked through the process of using the AVM debugger from AlgoKit Python utils to debug an Algorand Smart Contract. We set up a debugging environment, loaded a smart contract with a planted bug, stepped through the execution, and identified the issue. This process can be invaluable when developing and testing smart contracts on the Algorand blockchain. It's highly recommended to thoroughly test your smart contracts to ensure they function as expected and prevent costly errors in production before deploying them to the main network.
