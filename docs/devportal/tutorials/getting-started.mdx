**Hello, Developer! Welcome to Algorand!**

This quick start guide will help you set up your development environment, create your first Algorand project with AlgoKit, and deploy your first Algorand smart contract. By the end of this guide, you’ll be ready to build your own decentralized application on the Algorand blockchain.

AlgoKit is a comprehensive toolkit that allows developers to quickly and easily build and launch secure, automated, production-ready decentralized applications on the Algorand protocol. With AlgoKit 2.0, you can now write Algorand smart contracts using Python, one of the world’s most popular programming languages.

In addition, AlgoKit features:

- A library of smart contract templates to kickstart your project.
- Local application infrastructure setup.
- Toolchain integrations for popular languages like Python and TypeScript.
- A simplified frontend design experience.

Let's get started!

## Development Environment Setup

Let's first set up your development environment to start building on Algorand. Follow the instructions below and install
all of the prerequisites and AlgoKit.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [PipX](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/#on-linux-install-via-pip-requires-pip-190-or-later)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git)

This method will install the most recent python3 version [via winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).
If you already have Python 3.12+ installed, you may prefer to use `pipx install algokit` as explained within the pipx on any OS section
so you can control the Python version used.

### Verify the Installation

To verify AlgoKit installed correctly run the following.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
algokit --version
```

Output similar to the following should be displayed:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
algokit, version 2.1.2
```

## Start a LocalNet

When building smart contracts, start by testing on a local Algorand blockchain running on your computer. Deploying and calling smart contracts on mainnet (the live public blockchain for production) costs real money. Deploying on testnet (a replica of mainnet for testing) can be cumbersome. Therefore, it is recommended to first test on the local blockchain. Once everything works, move to testnet for final testing, and then deploy to mainnet to launch your application.

AlgoKit supports using a [local version of the Algorand blockchain](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md). To start an instance of this LocalNet
first open Docker Desktop on your computer and then run the following command from the terminal:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
algokit localnet start
```

This should start an instance of the LocalNet within docker. If you go to the Docker Desktop application you should see something similar to the following:

<Image src={dockerLocalnetImage} alt='Image of Docker Desktop after launching localnet' />

## Create an AlgoKit Project

Now, let's create an Algorand project with AlgoKit. We will refer to these projects as "AlgoKit projects."
AlgoKit provides a series of templates for you to use depending on the type of project you want to create.

<Steps>

1. To create a new AlgoKit project you can easily do so by running:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
      algokit init
   ```

   This will launch a guided menu system to create a specific project tailored to your needs. You will first
   be prompted to select the type of project you want to create. For this quick start guide, we will use the Python
   smart contract template, so select the "Smart Contracts" option.

   <Image src={algokitInit1} alt='AlgoKit Init #1' />

2. Next, AlgoKit will ask you what programming language you want to use for the smart contract. With AlgoKit 2.0, you can now write
   Algorand smart contracts with native Python. Let's select "Python" as our smart contract language by pressing enter.<Image src={algokitInit2} alt="AlgoKit Init #2" />

3. Then AlgoKit will ask you for the name of the project. Let's name it "hello-algorand", but if you want to name it differently, feel free to do so!
   After writing the name, press enter to continue.<Image src={algokitInit3} alt="AlgoKit Init #3" />

4. Next you can set the name of the smart contract. We will keep it as it is for now.<Image src={algokitInit4} alt="AlgoKit Init #4" />

5. Next, you can select the template preset. The "Starter" preset is for quickly implementing and testing certain features
   whereas the "Production" preset is for production-ready applications. For this guide, let's select "Starter".<Image src={algokitInit5} alt="AlgoKit Init #5" />

6. Next, AlgoKit will ask you what language you want to use for contract deployment. After writing your smart contract
   you need to deploy and call the contract either from your frontend or backend. Since most frontend frameworks
   are in TypeScript, let's select TypeScript for this guide.<Image src={algokitInit6} alt="AlgoKit Init #6" />

7. Next, AlgoKit will ask you if you want to run the `algokit project bootstrap` command to install the necessary dependencies.
   Say yes by pressing "y" This process can take a few minutes.<Image src={algokitInit7} alt="AlgoKit Init #7" />

8. Finally, AlgoKit will ask you if you want to initialize a git repository. Let's say yes by pressing "y" so that we can easily
   push our AlgoKit project to Github.<Image src={algokitInit8} alt="AlgoKit Init #8" />

9. Once finished, (if you have it installed) VS Code should automatically be opened with the
   initialized project and you will be prompted to install appropriate VS Code extensions.<Image src={algokitInit9} alt="AlgoKit Init #9" />

10. This starter app will contain one smart contract built with [Python](https://algorandfoundation.github.io/puya/)
    named `contract.py`, in the `smart_contracts/hello_world` folder, with one method `hello` that takes a `String` and returns a `String`.<Image src={algokitInit10} alt="AlgoKit Init #10" />

</Steps>

## Run the Demo Application

Once the starter project is created, you will notice in the `smart_contracts/hello_world` folder a
file named `deploy_config.ts` which is a simple example of using AlgoKit to deploy and make a call
to the `contract.py` smart contract on the LocalNet instance started earlier.

Now there are two ways to run the `deploy-config.ts` file to deploy and call the smart contract:

<Steps>

1. By hitting F5 it will start LocalNet, build the smart contract, deploy and
   call the smart contract `contract.py` by running the `deploy-config.ts` file.
   The output should look similar to the following:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   === Deploying HelloWorld === Idempotently
   deploying app "HelloWorld" from creator
   3TKAAPLBGRDCFF2M35X7TCZFMSSEAKV6WHJWOVO6C7LTFG2OAMJ5AA72AM using 85 bytes of
   teal code and 4 bytes of teal code App HelloWorld not found in apps created by
   3TKAAPLBGRDCFF2M35X7TCZFMSSEAKV6WHJWOVO6C7LTFG2OAMJ5AA72AM; deploying app with
   version 1.0. Created app 1002 from creator
   3TKAAPLBGRDCFF2M35X7TCZFMSSEAKV6WHJWOVO6C7LTFG2OAMJ5AA72AM Called hello on
   HelloWorld (1002) with name = world, received: Hello, world
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can run the following commands from the terminal to build
   and run the `deploy-config.ts` file:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=terminal
   algokit project run build
   algokit project deploy localnet
   ```

   The output should look similar to the following:

   <Image src={algokitBuildDeploy} alt='AlgoKit Build and Deploy with CLI' />

</Steps>

The App ID of of the deployed contract and its Algorand address is displayed, followed by the message returned from the smart contract call `Hello, world`.

Additionally, you can find the native TEAL smart contract code and the appropriate smart contract
manifest JSON files automatically generated in the `artifacts` folder.

:::note[You are an Algorand developer now!]
Congratulations and great job for getting this far!
At this point you have deployed a simple contract to an Algorand network and called it successfully!

You are now ready to start building your own decentralized applications on the Algorand blockchain!
