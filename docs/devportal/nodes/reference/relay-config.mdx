title: Configure a Node as a Relay
description: This guide outlines setting up a relay node in Algorand by configuring NetAddress in config.json and connecting other nodes via goal node start. Relay nodes should avoid account interaction or consensus participation.
---

A benefit of Algorand's decentralized network implementation is that a relay is effectively the same as any other node. The distinction currently is made by configuring a node to actively listen for connections from other nodes and having itself advertised using SRV records available through DNS.

It is possible to set up a relay for a personal network that does not require DNS entries. This is done using the following steps.

## Install a Node

See this page for [node hardware requirements](/nodes/installation/manual-installation#hardware-requirements).
Follow the [install instructions](/nodes/installation/manual-installation) for the specific operating system that the relay will run on.

## Edit the Configuration File

Edit the configuration file for the node as described in the [configuration](/nodes/reference/config-settings) guide. Set the property `NetAddress` to `":4161"` for TestNet or to `":4160"` for MainNet. Then the file. Make sure the file is named `config.json`.

Concretely, your `config.json` file should look like the following for TestNet:

```json
{
  "NetAddress": ":4161"
}
```

:::caution
It is not recommended that relay nodes interact with accounts or participate in consensus.

## Start the Relay Node

Start the node as described in the [install](/nodes/installation/manual-installation) guide. The node will now listen for incoming traffic on port 4161 for TestNet or on port 4160 for MainNet. Other nodes can now connect to this relay.

## Connect a Node to the Relay

Any node can connect to this relay by specifying it in the `goal node start` command. Use 4161 for TestNet or 4160 for MainNet.

```
goal node start -p "ipaddress:4161"
```

The node can also be set up to connect to multiple relays using a `;` separated list of relays.

```
goal node start -p "ipaddress-1:4161;ipaddress-2:4161"
```

:::caution
Using the above process will prevent the node from connecting to any of the Algorand networks. See the [Phonebook](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/reference/artifacts/?from_query=phonebook#phonebookjson) documentation for more information on how nodes connect to relays.
