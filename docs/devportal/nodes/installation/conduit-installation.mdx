Conduit is a framework for ingesting blocks from the Algorand blockchain into external applications. It is designed as modular plugin system that allows users to configure their own data pipelines for filtering, aggregation, and storage of blockchain data.

For example, use conduit to:

- Build a notification system for on chain events.
- Power a next generation block explorer.
- Select app specific data and write it to a custom database.
- Build a custom Indexer for a new [ARC](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs).
- Send blockchain data to another streaming data platform for additional processing (e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka, ZeroMQ).
- Build an NFT catalog based on different standards.

## System Requirements

For a simple deployment the following configuration works well:

- Network: Conduit colocated with Algod follower.
- Conduit + Algod: 4 CPU and 8 GB of ram.
  - Storage: algod follower node, 40 GiB, 3000 IOPS minimum.
  - Deployments allocating less ram might work in conjunction with [GOMEMLIMIT](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime@master#hdr-Environment_Variables) for Algod (and even Conduit). This configuration is not tested, so use with caution and monitor closely.

## Installation

### Download

The latest `conduit` binary can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/algorand/conduit/releases).

### Docker

[The latest docker image is on docker hub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/algorand/conduit)

### Install from Source

<Steps>

1. Checkout the repo, or download the source:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   git clone https://github.com/algorand/conduit.git && cd conduit
   ```

2. Run Conduit:

   ```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
   make conduit
   ```

</Steps>

The binary is created at `cmd/conduit/conduit`.

## Usage

Conduit is configured with a YAML file named `conduit.yml`. This file defines the pipeline behavior by enabling and configuring different plugins.

### Create configuration file

Use the `conduit init` subcommand to create a configuration template. Place the configuration template in a new data directory. By convention the directory is named `data` and is referred to as the data directory.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
mkdir data
./conduit init > data/conduit.yml
```

A Conduit pipeline is composed of 3 components, Importers, Processors, and Exporters.
Every pipeline must define exactly 1 Importer, exactly 1 Exporter, and can optionally define a series of 0 or more Processors. See a full list of available plugins with `conduit list`.

Here is an example `conduit.yml` that configures two plugins:

```yaml showLineNumbers=false frame=none
importer:
  name: algod
  config:
    mode: 'follower'
    netaddr: 'http://your-follower-node:1234'
    token: 'your API token'

# no processors defined for this configuration
processors:

exporter:
  name: file_writer
  config:
    # the default config writes block data to the data directory.
```

The `conduit init` command can also be used to select which plugins to include in the template. The example below uses the standard algod importer and sends the data to PostgreSQL. This example does not use any processor plugins.

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
./conduit init --importer algod --exporter postgresql > data/conduit.yml
```

Before running Conduit you need to review and modify `conduit.yml` according to your environment.

### Run Conduit

Once configured, start Conduit with your data directory as an argument:

```shell showLineNumbers=false frame=none
./conduit -d data
```

## External Plugins

Conduit supports external plugins which can be developed by anyone.
