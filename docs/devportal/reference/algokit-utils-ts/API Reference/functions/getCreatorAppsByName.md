> **getCreatorAppsByName**(`creatorAccount`, `indexer`): `Promise`\<`AppLookup`\>

:::caution[Deprecated]
Use `algorand.appDeployer.getCreatorAppsByName` instead.

Returns a lookup of name => app metadata (id, address, ...metadata) for all apps created by the given account that have an `AppDeployNote` in the transaction note of the creation transaction.

**Note:** It's recommended this is only called once and then stored since it's a somewhat expensive operation (multiple indexer calls).
:::

`string` | `SendTransactionFrom`

## Returns

`Promise`\<`AppLookup`\>
